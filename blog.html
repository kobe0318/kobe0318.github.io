		<h1>F8 2019 VR Rumors</h1>
			<br>
		<h3>April 17, 2019</h3>
		<br>
			<p>
				Facebook's Developer Conference, F8, is coming up on April 30th-May 1st. I am a believer of VR being the future. I own an Oculus Rift and it is truly something you have to experience. The feeling you get is like nothing else I have used before. Facebook and Oculus have announced 
				2 new VR headsets, being the Oculus Rift S and the Oculus Quest. The Rift S is a PC-tethered headset (like the original rift) and uses your computer for majority of the graphical and processing power. The Rift S ditches the external sensors that the original Rift had and replaces it with sensors around the headset that tracks controllers as well the environment around you to create your guardian system, which is the safety-net feature that shows a grid near the edge of your playspace to tell you when you get too close to the edge of it. The Quest on the other hand, is a wireless experience. The headset does everything and all you need for it to work is the battery in the headset to be charged and a decent sized playspace. The graphics potential of the Quest is lower than the Rift S, but this is to be expected. Both are rumored to be available for purchase during the F8 conference on May 1st. The Rift S is stated to be $500 USD with the Quest being $400 USD.

			My girlfriend and I booked a trip to New York City in May! We're both super excited to visit NYC; we both have been there, but it has been about 9 years since I last visited. I am a little anxious because of how big New York City is and it being only me and my girlfriend.

    North Carolina Defeats Duke 79-70
    </h1>

    <br>
    <p>
      The Tarheels have taken down the (highly) overrated
      Duke Blue Devils in the Dean Smith Center. This is the second
      time the Heels have defeated Duke this season. With the ACC tournament
      starting next week, North Carolina is looking at having to
      potentially embarass them once more once Zion Williamson
      returns from his injury.
